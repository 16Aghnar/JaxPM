# JaxPM
JAX-powered Cosmological Particle-Mesh N-body Solver

The goal of this project is to build the next generation of differentiable PM solvers, using JAX as the backend.

This project is currently in an early design phased. All inputs are welcome on the [design document](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/JaxPM/blob/main/design.md)
